Dotfiles are those files and directories found in Unix-based operating systems
encharged of saving customization settings of user applications. As the name
implies, these dotfiles usually start with a `.` in their names.

These are my personal dotfiles to keep them archived in case I ~~screw up my
system~~ switch computers and need to get things settled quickly.
